Sound clarity is not good if we raise the volume. Alexa has many functions and its feels good to have a personal assistant. But the sound features are not good as expected. Feel like returning the product.. I would recommend if people are looking for Bluetooth speakers that can be carried to functions and small parties Bose speakers are the best option ever!\\nReceived the product on time!!
